# Social Recovery Wallet Challenge - ETH Tech Tree
*This challenge is meant to be used in the context of the [ETH Tech Tree](https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/eth-tech-tree).*

Mother's day is coming up and you decide to send your mom some ETH to help her learn more about your world. You set up a new MetaMask wallet and write down the seed phrase on a nice piece of flowered stationary. You briefly consider taking custody of the phrase on her behalf, but ultimately decide against it. To understand your cypherpunk values, she needs to truly own her new gift. She's ecstatic. She immediately hops online, and for the next few days, continues to explore the rich new world that is web3. Then...disaster strikes. Her laptop dies and she's LOST HER SEED PHRASE.

## Challenge Description

A year has passed, and after the horrific debacle of last year's Mother's day, you've vowed to come up with a more user-friendly wallet design. You need it to be able to withstand the loss of a seed phrase, while retaining as much autonomy as possible.

But how?? You hearken back to your own upbringing for inspiration. Sure, your mom was a central figure, but ultimately, you realize, **it took a village**. You decide to develop your new wallet with this same strategy. What if you could select a group of trustworthy `guardian` addresses that could come together to recover the wallet after the seed phrase was lost.

With that idea, you begin work on your project in `packages/foundry/contracts/SocialRecoveryWallet.sol`.
