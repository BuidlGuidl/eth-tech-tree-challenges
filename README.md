# ETH Tech Tree Challenges
This repository is the home of all the challenges in the [ETH Tech Tree](https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/eth-tech-tree).

## Structure of the repository
The `main` branch is set up to give you everything you need to build new challenges. This includes instructions (below) and scripts for adding the new challenges as branches.

The other branches are the challenges. They are represented by the minimum set of file changes that will need to be made to a fresh clone of [Scaffold-ETH-2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2). The logic that determines how to add the files (and remove unnecessary files) can be found [here](https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/eth-tech-tree/blob/main/src/utils/setupChallenge.ts) though you shouldn't need to look at it to add a new challenge.

## Creating new challenges
WIP - Would like to add a script that sets up a repo, then you just make your edits, then allows you to push only your changes to a new challenge branch on your own fork of this repository.
