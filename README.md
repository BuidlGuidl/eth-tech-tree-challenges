# ETH Streaming Challenge - ETH Tech Tree
*This challenge is meant to be used in the context of the [ETH Tech Tree](https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/eth-tech-tree).*

In a world where asset allocation mechanisms have grown stale, a visionary group of technologists known as **_The StreamWeavers_** emerges. Their mission is to pioneer novel means of distributing capital that incentivize creativity and coordination. As a core developer for **_The StreamWeavers_**, you are tasked with forging the smart contracts that will allow this new system to flourish and ensure that everyone can manage their digital assets freely.

## Challenge Description

Amidst a backdrop where centralized control over capital resources stifles innovation and freedom, your challenge is to write a smart contract named "EthStreaming". This contract will empower authorized users to manage Ethereum assets in a decentralized manner, ensuring that the flow of resources is as continuous and uninterrupted as the ideals we uphold. Designated accounts will be permitted to withdraw predefined amounts of ETH, dictated by the passage of time since their last withdrawal.

As the architect, you will start this endeavor in `packages/foundry/contracts/EthStreaming.sol` where you will craft a new paradigm where freedom and resources flow hand in hand.
