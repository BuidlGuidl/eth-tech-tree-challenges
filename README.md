# DAO governance proposals and Voting - ETH Tech Tree
*This challenge is meant to be used in the context of the [ETH Tech Tree](https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/eth-tech-tree).*

In a dystopian future where mega-corporations have seized control over all aspects of life, a brave group of technologists and activists form an underground movement known as **_The Decentralized Resistance_**. Their mission is to create a new society governed by the people, free from the tyranny of corporate overlords. They believe that blockchain technology holds the key to building a fair and transparent governance system. As a key developer in **_The Decentralized Resistance_**, you are tasked with creating the smart contracts that will enable this new society to thrive.

## Challenge Description

**_The Decentralized Resistance_** has grown rapidly, attracting members from all walks of life who are united in their desire for freedom and self-governance. To ensure that every member's voice is heard, the resistance needs a secure and transparent voting system.

Your task is to create a smart contract that allows token holders to propose and vote on various proposals. For this challenge, you will implement a contract that supports the following:

**Proposal Creation:** Token holders can create proposals. Each proposal has a title, a unique ID, a voting deadline, and an address of the creator.

**Voting:** Token holders can vote on proposals with one of three predefined options: Yea, Nay, or Abstain. The weight of their vote is determined by the number of tokens they hold.

**Result Calculation:** The system calculates the result of the vote after the voting period ends.

You will start your task in `packages/foundry/contracts/Governance.sol`. Use your Solidity skills to enable **_The Decentralized Resistance_** to govern itself effectively! 
Follow the requirements in the contract to complete the challenge. Good luck!
